Suppose we want to extend the previous code by creating clients for the following courses: CS202, MA203, CS201. The server maintains separate files for each individual type of client, where the file corresponding to a client contains the names of the instructors involved in the course. For example, the file "Instructors_CS202.txt" corresponding to the client CS202 should contain Dr. Arijit Nath and Dr. Manojit Ghosh in separate lines. A client can make a number of different types of request to the server.
Request Type 1: Ask the server for the number of faculties involved in a course. The server returns the number of faculties involved, which is shown in the corresponding client's terminal. For example, for the CS202 course, the server should return 2 as the number of faculties involved is 2.
Request Type 2: Ask the server about the names of the faculty members involved. The server returns the names of the faculties involved in the course as a comma separated list, which needs to be shown in the client's terminal.
*Output should be demonstrated in a similar way as in Part A, whereas server should respond according to the type of request made to it which needs to be shown in the corresponding client's terminal.
